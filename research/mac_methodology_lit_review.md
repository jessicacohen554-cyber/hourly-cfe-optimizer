## 1. The Core Problem: Non-Monotonic MACs from Independent Optimization

When each CFE threshold is optimized independently, the portfolio can shift discontinuously between adjacent thresholds. The "marginal cost" between thresholds isn't a true marginal (incremental resource addition) — it's comparing two independently optimized systems.

**Observed in our data**:
- NYISO: $887/ton at 95→97.5% (expensive CCS entry), then $56/ton at 97.5→99% (storage unlocks efficiency)
- NEISO: CO2 abatement *decreases* at 95→97.5% despite costs rising (CCS displaces zero-emission VRE)
- ERCOT: CO2 abatement *decreases* at 97.5→99% (over-procurement → curtailment)

**Root cause**: Portfolio phase transitions in the optimization landscape. Small constraint changes tip the optimizer to structurally different solutions.

## 2. Two Fundamentally Different MAC Constructions

### a) McKinsey-Style (Average Cost MACC)
- Each bar = one discrete measure with its individual $/tCO2
- Height = average cost; width = abatement potential
- Static, single-period; treats measures independently
- **Problem**: Ignores measure interactions, path dependence

### b) Model-Derived (Marginal Cost MACC)
- Generated by running optimization at successively tighter constraints
- Each point = system-wide marginal cost of the last ton abated
- The system re-optimizes at each point → portfolio rebalancing artifacts
- **Our optimizer produces this type**

**Key reference**: Kesicki & Strachan (2011), "Marginal Abatement Cost Curves: Confronting Theory and Practice"

## 3. How Major Models Handle This

### Parametric Carbon Price Method (TIMES/MARKAL/MESSAGE)
Run optimization at N different carbon price levels. At each price, model finds least-cost system. Emission levels at each price trace the MAC curve. Produces **smoother** curves because the carbon price is a continuous variable.

### Emission Constraint Method
Impose successively tighter emission caps. Shadow price of the constraint = marginal abatement cost. Can still produce non-monotonic results.

### Decomposition Analysis (Kesicki 2013)
Combines MARKAL with index decomposition analysis to recover technology-specific contributions from smooth model curves. Bridges the gap between model-derived smoothness and McKinsey-style technology detail.

## 5. Solutions from the Literature

### a) Systems MAC / MAC 2.0 (Evolved Energy Research / EDF, 2021)
- Progressively increase carbon price; observe which resources enter in what order
- Curve built by **sequence of entry**, not independent optimization
- Produces monotonic curve by construction
- **Citation**: [EDF Report](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/MACC_2.0%20report_Evolved_EDF.pdf)

### b) Monotonic Envelope Construction
- Take convex hull or monotonic envelope of non-monotonic points
- Smooths out rebalancing artifacts while preserving overall cost trajectory
- **Statistical approach** — no re-optimization needed

### c) Scenario Ensembles
- Show range of costs across multiple optimization runs with different assumptions
- Portfolio rebalancing issue absorbed into the uncertainty band
- **Citation**: Deane et al. (2020), *Applied Energy*

### d) Conservation Supply Curve (Meier & Rosenfeld, 1982)
- Rank resources by marginal cost of contributing to the target
- Stack cheapest to most expensive
- **Merit order construction** — the original MACC approach
- **Citation**: LBNL/OSTI

### e) Step-wise Model MAC (Weidner et al., 2022)
- Linear optimization with hourly resolution
- Produces step-wise MACs showing least-cost sequential order
- **Citation**: *J. Cleaner Production*

## 6. Uncertainty Visualization Methods

### Monte Carlo MAC Envelopes
- Sample input parameters from probability distributions
- Produces true probability distribution of MAC at each level
- **Citations**: Peng et al. (2018) — transport; Eory et al. (2018) — agriculture; Springer (2019) — water

### Sensitivity-Based MAC Bands (Low/Mid/High)
- Run MAC at L/M/H cost assumptions, show all three
- McKinsey tested with discount rates (societal, 10%, 30%)
- Kesicki (2013) tested with fossil fuel price assumptions
- **Our project**: 324 paired-toggle combos = strong factorial design

### IPCC AR6 Approach
- Box-and-whisker at each carbon price level
- Shaded uncertainty bands around central estimate
- 90% confidence intervals on components
- Underlying: 1,686 vetted scenarios from IAMs
- **Citation**: IPCC AR6 WGIII Chapter 12, Figure SPM.7

### Fan Charts
- Bank of England origin; progressively wider CIs
- Used in economic/climate modeling; not yet formalized for MAC curves

## 7. DAC as Backstop / Ceiling Price

DAC sets the upper bound on marginal abatement cost — any abatement cheaper than DAC should be pursued first.

| Source | DAC Cost Estimate |
|--------|-------------------|
| Barrage & Nordhaus (2024), DICE-2023 | $515/tCO2 median in 2050 |
| Sievert et al. (2024), *Joule* | Liquid solvent: $341 ($226-$544) |
| | Solid sorbent: $374 ($281-$579) |
| | CaO weathering: $371 ($230-$835) |
| Goldman Sachs | $300/ton threshold for cost savings |

### Social Cost of Carbon Benchmarks
| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| EPA interim (Biden) | $51/tCO2 |
| Rennert et al. (2022), *Nature* | $185/tCO2 (2% DR, CI: $44-$400) |
| EPA updated (2023) | $190/tCO2 |
| EU ETS (recent) | $60-100/tCO2 |

**Relationship**: At efficient emission level, SCC = marginal abatement cost. Any abatement cheaper than SCC passes benefit-cost test. DAC sets absolute ceiling.

## 8. Statistical Soundness of Our 324-Scenario Approach

### What makes it rigorous
1. **Factorial experimental design**: 3^5 combinations across 5 paired toggles (minus transmission 4-level) = 324
2. **Captures interaction effects**: renewable × firm × storage × fossil × transmission
3. **Natural envelope**: produces range of MAC outcomes
4. **More comprehensive than most published studies** (typically vary 1-2 parameters)

### Comparable to
- Deane et al. (2020) scenario ensemble with Irish TIMES model
- McKinsey sensitivity analyses
- IPCC scenario-based ranges

### Gap vs. full statistical rigor
- Without probability distributions on L/M/H bounds, cannot assign confidence levels
- Same limitation as McKinsey and IPCC approaches
- Could upgrade: assign distributions to L/M/H, run Monte Carlo → true confidence bands
